# Ajax

This is sort of out of order, but I wanted to try my hand at some simple Ajax.
I will add a button to the info page that allows weather to be requested.
Note that this is client side, so that needs to be added to the info.hbs template.

So far this fails.  My ajax request is rejected due to a cross domain issue
(CORS).  Unresolved at of 4-24-2020.
