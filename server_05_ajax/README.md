# Ajax

This is sort of out of order, but I wanted to try my hand at some simple Ajax.
I will add a button to the info page that allows weather to be requested.
Note that this is client side, so that needs to be added to the info.hbs template.

I had to add a plugin called "Allow CORS" to my browser before the Ajax
to geonames.org would work.  And I had to click it to actually allow (the plugin
allows me to toggle this on or off).  It is not a total surprise that I would
need to do this, certain servers may also reject this sort of thing.
