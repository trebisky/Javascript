# temps

Here is something for real!!
Some time ago, I built an ESP8266 based temperature monitor gadget.
It has Wifi, and every minute makes a connection and sends a temperature
reading to a waiting server.  I wrote the original server in just a
few lines of Ruby, and it works just fine.

I am including the source for the ruby server here, just for reference.
I thought it would be fun and interesting to write the server in
Javascript using node.js, so here we are.
