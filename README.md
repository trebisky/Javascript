# Javascript
These are my simple javascript experiments.
It is unlikely that anyone will find them hugely beneficial,
but here they are anyhow.

They are in three groups, as indicated by the first word in the
directory name.

* client - typically one html file that runs in the browser
* node - a simple non-web oriented node script
* server - some kind of node/npm project, typically running a
    server on localhost:3000
