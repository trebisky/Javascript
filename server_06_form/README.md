# express with forms, POST, and body-parser

I trimmed a lot out of the past demo, which was sort of growing out
of bounds, and reduced this to a simple demo of a form, with a little
bit of monkey business with a button and a link mapped to client side
javascript.

I use the handlebars #if helper (even though I could have done the
same using some javascript logic in this case).

The plan is to move on to sessions in the next demo and build on this.
