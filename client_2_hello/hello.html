<!--
This is sort of an "improvement" over the basic hello
I presented in example 1.  Here I am using the onload
attribute to specify a javascript function to run after
the document is loaded.  This allows me then to inspect
the DOM and find the results object and put my text
into it.

Note that if you are using chrome, F12 gives you their dandy
Javascript console and debugger.

<script>
function my_hello ()
{
    document.getElementById("results").innerHTML="Hello world";
}
</script>

<body onload="my_hello()">

<h3>Today's message should appear below.</h3>

<div id = "results"></div>

</body>
