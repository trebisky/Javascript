<!--
The idea here is to write the simplest possible javascript that
will put the text "hello world" onto a web page.
Many tutorials will have you use alert, which lauches a popup.
Others have you use console.log, which goes to some log
(which you should learn about someday), but not to the page.

I first tried setting up a "div" and then locating it and
adding text to it.  This fails because of a fine point.
The javascript runs before the page is displayed and this
"div" does not exist yet in the DOM!

The code below works.  As near as I can tell, the javascript
runs first, then the html adds content after whatever the
javascript has placed in the document.
-->

<script>
// document.getElementById("results").innerHTML="Hello world";
document.write ( "Hello world" );
</script>

<body>

<h3>Today's message should appear above.</h3>

<div id = "results"></div>

</body>

</html>
