<!--
Can we have a form just to have a button?  You bet!

Here we have a button generate a javascript event.
We also add a variable so we can count and display how
many times the button gets pushed.

Note that the text "Ready" is never seen, it is immediately
overwritten by the function called by onload.

And a note here.  I always use javascript embedded in the html
as I am doing here.  It keeps the examples all in one file, but
more importantly by far, it avoids a browser caching issue.
If you are developing javascript and changing an external
xxx.js file, there seems to be no earthly way to get the browser
to stop using the cached copy and reload the new javascript.
So I stick to embedded javascript.  If I was going to production
on a high traffic website, there might be advantages to having
a separate file with the javascript.

<script>
function my_hello ()
{
    document.getElementById("results").innerHTML="Hello world";
}

var count = 0;

function next_handler ()
{
    count++;
    var msg = "Hello Charlie " + count;

    document.getElementById("results").innerHTML=msg;
}
</script>

<body onload="my_hello()">

<h3>Just click the button</h3>

<div id = "results">Ready</div>

<p>
<form name="myform">
<input type="button" value="Next" onclick="next_handler()">
</form>

</body>
