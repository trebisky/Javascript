# Handlebars

This was a LOT of work.
Getting handlebars set up is a pain, but once you get it going,
it is a worthwhile thing.  In this example, I have kept the
actual handlebars setup basic and tried to (mostly) just take
all the defaults (other than changing the template file extension
to ".hbs").

All the interesting notes are in the comments in the info.js file.
